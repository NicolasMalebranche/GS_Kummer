\section{Conclusion}
Let us summarize our results on $\theta^*$:
\begin{theorem}\label{thetaTheorem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The homomorphism $\theta^* : H^*(A\hilb{3},\Q)\rightarrow H^*(\kum{A}{2},\Q)$ of graded rings is surjective in every degree except $4$. Moreover, the image of $H^4(A\hilb{3},\Q)$ is equal to $\Sym^2(H^2(\kum{A}{2},\Q))$. 
The kernel of $\theta^*$ is the ideal generated by $H^1(A\hilb{3},\Q)$.
\item Working with integral coefficients, the image of $\theta^* : H^*(A\hilb{3},\Z)\rightarrow H^*(\kum{A}{2},\Z)$ is primitive in every degree except maybe $5$.
\end{enumerate}
%Proof: look at the ranks of H^*(A\hilb{3}):
%Rank H1*H4 = 188
%Rank H1*H5 = 239
%Rank H1*H6 = 196
%Rank H1*H7 = 102
%Rank H1*H8 = 40
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{basismain}
A basis of $H^*(\kum{A}{2},\Z)$ is given by the following classes:
